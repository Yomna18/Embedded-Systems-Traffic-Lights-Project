# Embedded-Systems-Traffic-Lights-Project
In our project, it was requested that we should implement two traffic lights and two pedestrian lights with 1 push button and 2 LEDs (green and red) each; where in each traffic light, the green light should stay for 5 seconds, yellow light for 2 seconds, then red light.

Exactly after 1 second, the next one shall repeat the previous sequence with same interval periods and so on.

For the pedestrian lights, itâ€™s needed that whenever the pedestrian presses the green light, the running traffic light should be interrupted in case it was on a green light, and the pedestrian green light would be green for 2 seconds then it will turn to red, and the running traffic light shall resume from when it was paused. For example, if the traffic light was green for 2 seconds and then interrupted by the pedestrian light, it will resume the remaining 3 seconds to complete the 5 seconds.

We have successfully implemented all of the previous tasks using interrupts and timers.

Also, we have succeeded in implementing the first bonus part which stated that:

If two pedestrians pressed two push buttons at the same time.

If the same button was pressed more than 1 time during the same period of the pedestrians crossing the street.

In case the button was pressed after 1 second from the end of the period of pedestrians crossing.
